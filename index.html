                                Im currently a student at College of the Canyons aiming to Transfer at CSUN (Cal State University of Northridge). 
                                I am studying for an Associates for Transfer in Computer Science at College of the Canyons and a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science at CSUN. 
                                I aim to have a profession in Software Engineering, Cyber Security or Web Development at any major company. 
                                I've had an interest in coding since I was in middle school. Funny enough, it started because of this video game called Watch Dogs
                                and I wanted to be the best hacker around like the main character.
