                                Im currently a student at College of the Canyons aiming to Transfer at CSUN (Cal State University of Northridge). 
                                I am studying for an Associates for Transfer in Computer Science at College of the Canyons and a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science at CSUN. 
                                I aim to have a profession in Software Engineering, Cyber Security or Web Development at any major company. 
                                I've had an interest in coding since I was in middle school. Funny enough, it started because of this video game called Watch Dogs
                                and I wanted to be the best hacker around like the main character.

                                    Who's going to be the first company that allows me to put them up on this section? I'm hungry for <b>Experience</b>
                                    that will greatly improve my skills as a coder. I would definitely be great for any company to pick me up. 
                                    I'm that guy who puts in effort and makes the work experience fun for anyone who's around me.
